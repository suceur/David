Abstract: This study explores the effectiveness of deep learning and conventional machine learning techniques for time series forecasting of daily demand for an automotive product. The research compares the performance of neural network architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a hybrid model (CNN-LSTM), and traditional statistical approaches such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Holt-Winters exponential smoothing and Prophet. The study also investigates the impact of different data preparation approaches on the forecasting accuracy. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly LSTM and GRU, outperform conventional techniques in capturing complex patterns and dependencies in the time series data. The data preparation approach, which uses a sequence of past elements to predict the next step, proves to be the most effective for multi-step forecasting. The findings provide valuable insights for improving demand forecasting accuracy in the automotive industry and optimizing production planning processes.
